      <p><strong>Anna Laffrey, Instructor: John Kupetz</strong></p>
<blockquote>“The first Kupetz paper I got back was my roommate story, and there was literally more green ink on the paper than black ink from my writing. I was horrified, and I thought that it was because my writing was that bad, but I think it’s really because Kupetz is that good of an instructor. No matter how good your writing is he always has some way to make it better or something to say. Often times, he writes about two pages of comments and the end of your story and it’s not always bad. Actually for my trend story he gave me some praise at the beginning which kind of gave me the warm fuzzies. It’s very very hard to read his handwriting so even more than learning journalism over these five weeks, I’ve mastered the art of learning how to read Kupetz’s handwriting.”</blockquote>

      <h3>Other instructors, while they may not have  three iconic green pens hanging from their frockets like the one and only John Kupetz, each have their own unique editing styles.</h3>

    <p><strong>Kristina Karisch, Instructor: Katherine Dempsey</strong></p>
<blockquote>“My instructor is Katherine and she focuses a lot on line edits so it’s very comprehensive, and basically as much feedback as she can give you. It ends up being helpful because you know exactly what you need to do to fix your story. It can be a bit overwhelming, because there’s a lot of ink on the page, sometimes more than your writing, but in the end you sift through it and find what you need to fix.”</blockquote>
    &nbsp
    <p><strong>Michael Bass, Instructor: Joe Grimm</strong></p>
<blockquote>“Joe doesn’t have a predictable pen color or predictable technique, but what he does have is a good combination of line edits and general comments. He’ll correct AP style things and he’ll write complex descriptions of why he corrected things in the margins. He once said ‘I only make corrections with a reason’ and he does not hesitate to share those reasons."</blockquote>
    &nbsp
    <p><strong>Daera Thomas, Instructor: Charles Whitaker</strong></p>
<blockquote>"Charles will write like nice encouraging comments on the top. For example he’ll say ‘this is a really strong second draft’ and when you go through it there’s just so many comments. A lot of the time it’s not a lot of line editing; it’s a lot of this could be better switched here. he’ll give you a lot of helpful hints like maybe you should reach out to this person or maybe you should reach out to that person, but it’s pretty simple."</blockquote>
    &nbsp
    <p><strong>Margaux MacColl, Instructor: Paulina Firozi</strong></p>
<blockquote>"Paulina is a majestic editor. She’s got nice, neat handwriting so I always know what’s up. I never have to go back for clarification. It’s very clean cut. I think because she does a lot of news writing she makes my writing a lot more straightforward and she takes out a lot of the really unnecessary parts."</blockquote>
